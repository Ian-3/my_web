whats assigned to you. However, this can make you seem very uptight to other people. You speak your
mind, which is a blessing and a curse. You aren't necessarily selfish, but you put yourself first. If 
helping others doesn't get in the way of what you're doing, then you'll hapily help. Just like an 
earth sign, you're as stubborn as a rock.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p style="color:violet;font-size:300%;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;

that and you own it. You're a very precise person, you know what you want and you're gonna get it.
